Collection of pure python algorithm implementations to solve computational problems.

The goal is for these implementations to be:
- Elegant (clean, short, easy to understand).
- Theoretically efficient.
- Well tested.
- Well documented.

## Design principles

Some design principles taken into account (from the [Zen of Python]):
  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - Complex is better than complicated.
  - Flat is better than nested.
  - Sparse is better than dense.
  - Readability counts.
  - Errors should never pass silently.
  - Unless explicitly silenced.
  - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
